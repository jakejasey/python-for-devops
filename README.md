# Python for Devops

## Create project scafolding
    
    * Create development env that is cloud based: 

    ### Github Codespaces
        
        Build out scaffold: 
            * Makfile
            * requirements.txt
            * test_lib.py
            * python_library
            * Dockerfile
            * Command line tools    
            * Microservices 

        1. Create virt env
            I personally like to have a ~/python_env that contains
            all my python virtual enviornments. But they can also 
            be put into a ~/.venv directory. 



    ### Colab Notebook? - Not really needed
    ### AWS cloud shell
    ### AWS Cloud9

## Github Actions 
    - Check Yaml syntax


## Comman-Line tools

## Microservices 

## Containerized Continuous Deliver
